# Protocol Sign - Web3 Asset & Identity

Privacy e-contract signature, Biometrics DID, Proof of RWA, AI contract.

web3 privacy electronic signature, asset and identity carrier. It can be signed in a private manner, and only you can know the content of the contract. We have also created an AI contract generation tool, which can generate the contract you need in one sentence. Plus it s not just signatures. Electronic signatures are the carrier of assets. Essentially what we want to do is create programmable credentials on the chain for real-world assets. This can provide users with identity and asset ownership, freedom, and liquidity.

Decentralized privacy electronic contract signature platform. It can make the contract permanently stored on the arweave and make your contract have a stronger legal effect through biometrics and blockchain technology. Bring true privacy to your contracts with Dsign protocol, document is handed over to the network protocol for safekeeping.user can transfer files to friends through the privacy document, without worrying about confidential disclosure.

Protocol Sign will not only become a dApp similar to our traditional electronic signature platform, but it will also do something that the traditional platforms can't do:

**Permanent Contract Storage:** The data truly exists on the chain and is constantly globally synchronized by a large number of nodes.

**Immutability:** timestamp, identity, and contract contents are encrypted and packaged on the chain.

**Service Continuity:** Ensure sustainable execution through the protocol and managed by the developer community through DAO.

**One Payment:** Thanks to the on-chain storage protocol, there is no monthly payment. For each contract, you only need to pay for storage once, and you can always preview it on the dashboard in the future.

**Contract Privacy and Data Ownership:** the users browse the contract only through the private key, and it is executed by the agreement, and the third book and the platform cannot read the user's privacy.

**Trusted Identity:** Automatically binds identity and biological information.
